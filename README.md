## My process

My draft consisted on creating a div for every element I could count on the design and to add a solid border to easily differentiate it. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox


### Continued development

Things I need to work on:

- Responsive web design (viewport)
- Use rem over px
- Use 'variables' for things such as color so they are more descriptive on the code.
